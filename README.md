# Skin cancer detector
This is an image classifier capable to detect melanoma from a given picture, work in progress, currently trying to improve its accuracy.

The challenge comes from a mini project at Udacity, which I decided to take to check and improve my current computer vision skills, I do find this project quite interesting and I will hopefully get to a great accuracy by experimenting different types of networks.

The network is actually trainded to distinguish 3 different classes:

Being the goal of the network to detect Melanoma in an early stage and by doing so the patien have a 99% to 100% of probabilities of surviving if diagnosed during stage 1.
